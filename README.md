# Electronics Study Notebook

A personal repository for documenting my hands-on study of core electronics concepts. This serves as my reference library for the basic building blocks, from controlling an LED with a switch to building logic gates with transistors.

## What's Inside?

This repo is structured as a digital lab journal. For each concept I study, I aim to include:

* **Study Notes:** Explanations of the underlying theory.
* **Schematics:** Simple, clear circuit diagrams.
* **Photos:** Pictures of my breadboard setups.

## Concepts Covered

Here are some of the fundamental topics I'm exploring:

* **Basic I/O:**
    * Controlling an LED with a switch.
    * Using appropriate resistor.
* **Logic Gates:**
    * BUFFER, OR, AND and XOR gates made with NPN Transistors.
    * With schematics!
* *(...and more as I learn!)*

This collection is primarily for my own reference as I build my understanding from the ground up.
